## Recipe Project

I am currently exploring the foundations of HTML and CSS to refresh my memory and create a simple, yet great project.

## Process

Using the All Recipes website as an inspiration, I used Semantic Elements to build a recipe website where I added three personal recipes along with headings, texts, images, and captions. Followed by a list of ingredients and a list of steps.
